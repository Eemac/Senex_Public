A public-facing version of the SenexVR Codebase.

## What is Senex VR?
The Senex Suit, a flagship product of SenexVR, was designed to track body motion and simulate lifelike interactions in the virtual world. It provides high-fidelity data while remaining inexpensive and straightforward to use. Senex has also developed high-accuracy, real-time dead-reckoning modules capable of indoor and outdoor position tracking with an accuracy of under 3cm.
